The purpose of this control is to show audit information in a summarised and user-friendly way. The control only works for those records where Audit is available.


## Prerequisites
1. Only use this control where you have auditing data available.
2. It is recommended to have pictures available for your users in the entityimage field. They will show up on the cards.

## Installation
The control is available as a managed solution so it can be installed and uninstalled as usual with most ISV solutions.

## Configuration
After installation the control only needs two fields
1. Name - this can be any text field. 
2. Plain Rear Side - Set this to true if you want the card's rear side to be clear. By default, it display user's image which looks cool but some people may prefer clear.
